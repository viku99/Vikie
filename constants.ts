      analysis: 'The goal was to create a cohesive visual language across eight different product variants without becoming repetitive. By utilizing a "modular rhythm" workflow, I was able to maintain a high-energy pace while tailoring the motion curves of each video to match specific sonic transients in the soundtrack.'

    challenge: 'Showcasing a large volume of high-energy product edits without diluting the brand identity or overwhelming the viewer.',
    solution: 'Developed a unified kinetic framework that uses sharp masking and aggressive time-remapping to create a consistent "snap" across all assets, presented as a curated rhythmic collection.',

      analysis: 'Recruitment videos often suffer from being too "safe." For this AI firm, we went the opposite direction. We used a visual language that mirrors the complexity and speed of neural networks—fast cuts, high-frequency glitch effects, and a sonic landscape that feels futuristic.'

      analysis: 'The primary challenge was the 2-hour window from raw footage to final export. I built a modular AE project file where data is fed into a main composition through a CSV controller, allowing the editorial team to update text without opening complex nested compositions. The color palette was strictly controlled to maintain editorial authority while keeping the motion fluid and attention-grabbing.'

      analysis: 'To achieve the characteristic "snap" on every beat, I manually keyed the timeremap value using the Value Graph in AE. By creating extreme "S-curves", I was able to accelerate into the impact and linger on the follow-through, creating a much higher sense of kinetic energy than simple linear speed ramping. The audio was processed in Audition to isolate transients, which were then used as reference points for every single keyframe.'
    },
    challenge: 'Achieving perfect synchronization without automated plugins. Every hit needed to feel impactful through visual physics rather than just filters.',
    solution: 'This was edited entirely within After Effects. I used the Graph Editor for manual time-remapping, ensuring that speed curves aligned precisely with the audio waveform peaks. No "beat-sync" plugins were used; every frame was curated for maximum impact.',
